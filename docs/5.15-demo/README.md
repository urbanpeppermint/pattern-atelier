# Pattern Atelier — 5.15 Specs (2024) Demo Rebuild Pack

Self-contained instructions to rebuild **Pattern Atelier** as a **fresh Lens Studio 5.15.x** project for **Spectacles (2024)** wearable demos.

This pack lives next to the working **5.23 / CLAD** project. Do **not** open or convert the 5.23 `.esproj` in 5.15.

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `docs/5.15-demo/` (this folder) | Instructions + ready-to-paste prompts + art to copy |
| `Pattern Fashion AI/` (repo root) | **READ-ONLY reference** (5.23 CLAD version) |
| Your new folder e.g. `Pattern-Atelier-5.15-Demo/` | **WRITE target** (empty 5.15 project) |

## One-sentence goal

A Specs 2024 wearable that **looks like** the current editorial UI (mockup boards + EN▾ + assistant strip) and can place a **seeded pattern on a real surface** for a demo video — not full CLAD parity.
